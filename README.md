# Python_World_Happiness
World happiness data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness?resource=download) was processed using exploratory, correlation, cluster, and other analyses to better understand the factors that most impact happiness.

The following Python tools were used in the analysis:
* Jupyter Notebook: for writing and executing Python code
* Pandas: for data analization
* Seaborn: for data visualization
* Matplotlib: for data visualization
* Numpy: for mathematical equations
* SciPy: for mathematical equations

The project folders contain the raw data and also the python scripts created to analyze the data.
